# Who-s-That-Pokemon
I created this project to practise my .NET
This a simple webpage that shows a picture of one of the 905 Pokemon 
You then click the button to reveal the correct name. 

Features I would like to add to this would be: 
- A refresh button that brings up a new Pokemon 
- A text box that takes the users guess
- A filter system so the user can select which generation the Pokemon comes from
